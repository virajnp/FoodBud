Text Detection and Specific Restaurant Recommender App 

The main objective of this project is to develop an android system that could recognize the text (here in context of the restaurant names)
with the help of the ML kit along with the restaurants location with help of Google Places API. This restaurant text detection will
in turn help us for obtaining suggestion with similar cuisine type restaurants within a certain predefined radius.
